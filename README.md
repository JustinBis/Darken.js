**Darken.js**

----

Working at night is tough enough already, so why make your eyes suffer more than they have to?
Most websites show black text on a white (or at least bright) background. This is great during the day, but at night, our eyes need a break. That's where Darken.js comes in.

Simply add a single line to your page, and Darken.js takes care of the rest.

If the text is determined to be dark and the background bright, we reverse the color schemes. This makes the text far easier to read at night and causes far less eye fatigue. This doesn't affect images, as inverted color images just look silly, even at night.

Darken.js can be added to any website with nothing more than a few javascript includes.

```html
<!--jQuery and are requirements for Darken.js to work -->
<script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script>
<script src="/tinycolor.js"></script>
<script src="/darken.js"></script>
```
